# Lab Report 1

## No arguments:

```
[user@sahara ~]$ cd
[user@sahara ~]$ ls
lecture1
[user@sahara ~]$ cat
hola!
hola!
```

`cd` is used to change the directory. When cd is used in the terminal it jumps from one directory to another directory. 

`ls` shows the names of the files and folders inside the current working directory. It's another useful status-checking command.

`cat` essentially returns whats initially inputted.

Hence we see the following output as displayed in the above screenshot

## Path to a directory:

```
[user@sahara ~]$ cd lecture1
[user@sahara ~/lecture1]$ cd
[user@sahara ~]$ ls lecture1
Hello.class  Hello.java  messages  README
[user@sahara ~]$ cd
[user@sahara ~]$ cat lecture1
cat: lecture1: Is a directory
```

When a directory is provided in the code:

`cd` edirects to the directory lecture1

`ls` lists all the files in the directory lecture1

`cat` returns the content of the directory

## Path to a file:

```

```

`cd`
`ls`
`cat`
